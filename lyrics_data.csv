Man's Not Hot Lyrics



[Intro]
Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
Man's not hot, never hot
Skrrat, skidi-kat-kat
Boom

[Verse 1]
Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block
Smoke trees (ah)
See your girl in the park
That girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking (you man ducked)
Hold tight, Asznee (my brudda)
He's got the pumpy (big ting)
Hold tight, my man (my guy)
He's got the frisbee (shew)
I trap, trap, trap on the phone
Movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies, hold tight my girl Whitney (my G)
On, on, on, on, on the road doin' ten toes
Like my toes (like my toes)
You man thought I froze
I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin')
If she ain't on it, I ghost (hah!)
Look at your nose (check your nose fam)
You donut, nose long like garden hose

[Chorus]
I tell her man's not hot, I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, ""Take off your jacket""
I said, ""Babes, man's not hot"" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, ""Take off your jacket""
I said, ""Babes, man's not hot"" (never hot)

[Verse 2]
Hop out the four-door with the .44
It was one, two, three and four (us man)
Chillin' in the corridor (yo)
Your dad is forty-four (uh)
And he's still callin' man for a draw (look at him)
Let him know
When I see him
I'm gonna spin his jaw (finished)
Take man's Twix by force (take it)
Send man's shop by force (send him)
Your girl knows I've got the sauce (flexin')
No ketchup (none)
Just sauce (saucy)
Raw sauce (ah)
Yo, boom, ah

[Refrain]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah), du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom, you don' know

[Chorus]
I tell her man's not hot (man's not)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, ""Take off your jacket""
I said, ""Babes, man's not hot"" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, ""Take off your jacket""
I said, ""Babes, man's not hot""

[Bridge]
Man can never be hot (never hot)
Perspiration ting (spray dat)
Lynx Effect (come on)
You didn't hear me, did you? (nah)
Use roll-on (use that)
Or spray (shhh)
But either way, A-B-C-D (alphabet ting)

[Refrain]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah), du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom, you don' know

[Outro]
Big Shaq
Man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
40 degrees and man's not hot (come on)
Yo, in the sauna
Man's not hot (never hot)
Yeah, skidika-pap-pap

Him & I Lyrics



[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

[Verse 1: G-Eazy & Halsey]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (you know?)

[Chorus: Halsey & G-Eazy]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I

[Verse 2: G-Eazy & Halsey]
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (together), fuck up clubs together (together)
And we'd both go crazy (crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I

[Bridge: Halsey & G-Eazy]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (ayy)
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There is no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said “be true,” I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I

River Lyrics



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem]
One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...

[Verse 2: Eminem]
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never “The bride, hey!”
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
